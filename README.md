Hungryman is an online food-ordering and delivery website to connect customers with all kinds of restaurants. On the website, customers can view previous comments on different restaurants and choose the one they like. Once the customer makes an order online, the website will automatically choose a group of nearby delivery men, then they will decide whether or not to pick up food and bring it to the customer. The delivery fee will be calculated based on multiple factors such as distance, time and weather.
